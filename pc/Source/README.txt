If you are editing the source code, here are two things you might want to take note of:
	1) The program uses arguments, so will not run if you do not specify the COM Port.
	   Personally, I ran the built program from command prompt so I did not tell VS to
	   use any arguments.
	2) From a clean build, the 2 vJoy DLLs will not be in the right directory and the 
	   program will not run. Just copy the DLLs into the same folder as the exe to get
	   it running.

Happy Programming!
