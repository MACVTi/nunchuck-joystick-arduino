Note: You need to install vJoy before you can use this program.

To use this program:
	1) You will need to configure the vJoy controller to have the following inputs:
		Axes {X,Y,RX,RY,RZ},
		Buttons 2
	2) Open command prompt in the same directory as the .exe
	3) Type in the com port number as the first argument
		ie: NunchuckCSharp.exe COM5

All going well you should have controller input, which you can check by going into
"Monitor vJoy" or going into "Game Controllers"

Note: You can calibrate the controller but do be aware that the accelerometer can make 
      this a bit finicky
